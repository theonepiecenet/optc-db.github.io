The Continuation of the highly loved and apreciated OPTC Database.

This is a Database for all things One Piece Treasure Cruise, including Stats, Drops, Sockets and a Damage Calculator.

This project is written in html and js, using angular, bootstrap and jquery.

It is hosted on github pages, although you can just download it and run a local copy.

# Installation

Just download it and run it in some kind of Live preview or via xampp. Or better yet access it via http://optc-db.github.io
